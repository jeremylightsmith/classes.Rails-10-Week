For each question, write the url (i.e. "/artists/24").  Build a routes.rb file that will satisfy all the questions:

Do so RESTfully!


1. show artist w/ id 5
"GET /artists/5"
1.5. add an artist
"POST /artists"
params[:artist][:name]
params[:artist][:genre]
params[:artist][:label_id]
2. show an album w/ id 6

3. show all artists
"GET /artists"
4. show all albums

5. login
"GET /session/new"
"POST /session"
"GET /login"
"POST /session"
6. logout
"DELETE /session"

6. delete an artist
"DELETE /artist/2"
7. show all artists sorted by name

8. show all artists sorted by genre

9. have pretty urls, using artist names instead of ids

10. show all albums for a particular artist
"/albums?artist_id=5"
"/artists/5/albums"
"/artists/5/albums/3"

11. show all tracks for an album

12. add a track to an album

13. have pretty urls, where ONLY artist names were used for url i.e. "http://mymusicsite.com/queen"

14. have the root page of the site show all artists

15. allow paging of artist page (what do the urls look like for page 1, page 2, page 3?)
