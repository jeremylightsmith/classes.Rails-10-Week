implement a RESTful controller / view (do all the parts, in any order that makes sense)

== part 1 - Controller

implement a RESTful Artists Controller in the music project (in github).  Use tests!

it should :

  * show a list of artists
  * show a single artist
  * create a new artist
  * edit an artist
  * update an artist
  * delete an artist

== part 2 - Views

* implement the views to go with the controller
* you should be able to navigate between each page

== part 3 - Validation

* implement some validations in the model
* handle validations errors gracefully in the controller (use flash)
* show validation errors on the view
