STORY 6-1:
I would like to upload artist images that are displayed after being resized appropriately.

1) Make sure paperclip and image magick are installed and working.  You should be able to test this using the current version of the music example and the album edit & show pages.
2) Allow the user to upload a photo for the artist.  Display whatever image the user uploads.  
3) Resize the photo to 2 sizes, 450 x 450 pixels, also create a thumbnail size of 75 x 75 pixels.
4) Display the 450x450 image in the artists/show page, and display the 75x75 image on the artist index page

Note: Build this on top of the music example that you currently have running.  The code checked into github shows how to do this for the album.

You'll have to read the paperclip documentation to learn what you need to do.

I would like you to tell me what acts_as_soft_deletable does.

STORY 6-3:
As a new user to your site, I would like to sign up for your site.  

1) Have a signup button on the top of each page that takes you to the users/new page. 
2) By entering my name, email, and password, it should create a user for me.
3) When I say "every" page, that means that you probably want this in your application layout.  

STORY 6-4:
As a user that has already signed up to your site, I would like to login & logout using the email & password that I created.

1) When I'm not logged in, I should see a login & signup link at the top.  When I am logged in, I should see a logout link at the top.
2) The login link should take me to session/new, the logout link should take me to session/destroy
3) Upon logging in, you should save the logged in user's user_id in the session.
4) Upon logging out, you should delete the logged in user's user_id from the session.
5) In a before_filter, you should always check to see if a user is already logged in, and if so, make the logged in user available to all your controllers and views with a helper method called "current_user".
6) Using this helper method, you should be able to display login / signup in one case, and logout in the other case.

Note: For now, go ahead and store the password as regular text.  In a production app NEVER EVER EVER do this.  

STORY 6-5:
I would like to get feedback on what happened when logging in, signing up, and logging out.

1) Use the flash to display a note about what happened.  e.g. User created, Successful login, Couldn't find user / password, etc.
