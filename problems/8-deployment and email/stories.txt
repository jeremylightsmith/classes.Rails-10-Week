STORY 8-1:
Create your own "mail" project just like the one I created on github.  It should have the same behavior.  Deploy it to Heroku.

- create your rails project and get it working locally
- create a git repo
  - git init
  - git add .
  - git commit -m "initial checkin"
- create a heroku project
  - go to http://heroku.com/ and sign up for an account
  - sudo gem install heroku
  - heroku create <yourname>-mail
    - you'll have to enter your heroku credentials
- push to heroku
  - git push heroku master
- you should see it now at : <yourname>-mail.heroku.com

- configure heroku to be able to send e-mails
  - add the send grid add-on through the ui
- you should now be able to send yourself an e-mail

STORY 8-2:
Change the mail project to send a "hello" message that uses the user's name.  Get it from the form and send it instead of the test message.
