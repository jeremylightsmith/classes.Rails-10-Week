Either keep going on Roman Numerals OR Implement a Calculator

on a calculator object, I would want to :
- be able to "press" a key (a digit or operation, you can represent "keys" as "1", "2", "=", "+", "-")
- it should handle +, -, *, /, etc

Again, you don't have to finish.  The goal is to practice Red/Green/Refactor & Ping Pong Pairing.  

Practice until you are comfortable and feel like you could do the following in ~ 3 minutes.  
Feel free to try something, undo it, and show me the whole thing again.

This is what I'll be looking for.

* 2/3 rounds of ping pongs, it should take just a couple minutes
* pick something that will have a refactoring aspect
* explain to me what refactoring is
