Back to your music example...

STORY 7-1:
I would like to do a sort without my browser having to refresh.

- use remote_form_tag / remote_form_for instead the form you used for for the sort.
  - what url should this go to?
- replace the old list of albums with what you get back from the server.
- on the server side use a respond_to to make sure that you don't include a layout when being asked for js

STORY 7-2:
I would like to delete an album from the artist page and have the artist disappear from the page without the page reloading.

- use a link_to_remote tag
- in your controller use inline rjs to delete the album
