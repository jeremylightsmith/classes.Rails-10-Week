For each question, write the url (i.e. "/artists/24").  Build a routes.rb file that will satisfy all the questions:


1. show artist w/ id 5
"/artists/5"
2. show an album w/ id 6

3. show all artists
"/artists"
4. show all albums

5. login
"/login"
6. logout

6. delete an artist
"/artists/delete/5"
7. show all artists sorted by name

8. show all artists sorted by genre
"/artists/sorted_by/genre"
"/artists?sort=genre"

9. have pretty urls, using artist names instead of ids

10. show all albums for a particular artist

11. show all tracks for an album

12. add a track to an album

13. have pretty urls, where ONLY artist names were used for url i.e. "http://mymusicsite.com/queen"

14. have the root page of the site show all artists
"/"

15. allow paging of artist page (what do the urls look like for page 1, page 2, page 3?)
"/artists"
"/artists?page=2"
"/artists?page=3"
